## SUMMARY REPORT

### In summary the presentation makes it clear that NYC has a very successful CitiBike Sharing Service that appeals to male subscribers for use commuting to and from work during the weekday.  There is also lighter usage during non commute hours and weekends likely by tourists. The Investors should turn their focus to how they can measure the market in Des Moines of male bike commuters that work on a subscription basis as this will be their core business.  Secondarily they should try to market to the female commuters and tourists to keep their business strong.
